# Transfer-Learning-for-Waste-Image-Classification

Project Overview

This project focuses on image classification of nine types of waste using transfer learning with pre-trained deep learning models. The goal is to leverage features learned from large datasets (like ImageNet) to improve classification accuracy on a relatively small dataset.
